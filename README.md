# SFML-Linux-CompileScript
<p>
  This is my first Bash-Script, so there may be a lot of unnessecary stuff in there.  
  Also I never learned Bash-Scripting, I just wanted a handy Console-Command for compiling my SFML-Code.

## How to use
Example of a Project-Layout:

<ul>
  <li>Your *.cpp-Files need to be in the ```SourceFiles```</li>
</ul>
